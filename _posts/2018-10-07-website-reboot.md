I've had a pretty boring single html file website for quite some time.
Decided to change it up a bit and try out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the
popular static site generator. It has basic blog functionality and I prefer the simplicity of serving
static assets rather than messing around with maintaining a database.

The setup was quick and painless and it is extremely easy to work with. So
far it has been a pleasant experience. I have set up automatic deployments using
Travis CI, so hopefully that will encourage me to actually post some things
from time to time.
